        Howdy! I’m Chris Hall, owner of C&amp;D Lawn Service. Born and raised right here in Lexington, South Carolina, I grew up with a passion for turning an ordinary yard into something special. After years of mowing for family and friends I decided to make it official—and C&amp;D Lawn Service was born. Today we’re proud to be a local, family-run business built on honest work, southern hospitality and a genuine love for a well-cut lawn.<br><br>
        Every yard we maintain is treated as if it were our own. Whether you’re a busy homeowner who just needs a reliable mow every week, or a property manager looking for full-service maintenance, we’ve got you covered. We believe in showing up on time, doing the job right the first time and leaving your yard looking clean, green and welcoming. When you hire us you’re getting personal service directly from me and my team—not a faceless corporation.
